This Pelican plugin scans links and check their status codes. For responses such as 403 or 404, the plugin adds a `disabled` class to the anchor, extends the anchor with a `span` label, and prints a warning to the console logger.

Installation
------------

This plugin can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-deadlinks

As long as you have not explicitly added a `PLUGINS` setting to your Pelican settings file, then the newly-installed plugin should be automatically detected and enabled. Otherwise, you must add `deadlinks` to your existing `PLUGINS` list. For more information, please see the [How to Use Plugins](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html#how-to-use-plugins) documentation.

Usage
-----

To enable the dead link checker, set the `DEADLINKS_VALIDATION` option in your Pelican settings file to `True`. Alternatively, if you donâ€™t want to validate links every time, you can selectively enable link validation at run-time via:

    pelican content -e DEADLINKS_VALIDATION=true

Additionally, the following options can be changed:

```python
DEADLINKS_OPTIONS = {
    "archive": True,
    "classes": ["custom-class1", "disabled"],
    "labels": True,
    "timeout_duration_ms": 1000,
    "timeout_is_error": False,
}
```

Options:

| Name | Description | Default value |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| `archive` | True/False. When enabled invalid links will be replaced with proper archive.org entry | True |
| `classes` | List of classes to be add to anchor element | Empty list |
| `labels` | Insert bootstrap's label after the anchor element | False |
| `timeout_duration_ms` | Time in ms after which request is considered as timed out | 1000 |
| `timeout_is_error` | True/False. When enabled every time out is considered as dead link | False |
